this is very early into the progress and is not working any and all help is appreciated. i am currently reworking the card_factory.py to pull from a database rather than pulling from listed cards as this should be alot less work as there are online lists already and should be a faster lookup than it going though thousands of lines of code.

Nothing is well though out and i keep running into more modules needed to do all the tasks. the ai is very limited as well that will be a battle to sort out.
